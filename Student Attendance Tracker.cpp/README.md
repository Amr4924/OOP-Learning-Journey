# 🎓 Student Attendance Tracker

A simple C++ project that tracks student attendance using basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## 📘 Description
This program allows you to:
- Enter student information (name and ID)
- Mark attendance as **Present** or **Absent**
- Display the student's status clearly on the console

It was built to practice **classes**, **objects**, and **boolean logic** as part of my ongoing learning journey in C++.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects  
- Member Functions  
- Boolean Variables  
- Conditional Statements  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program asks for the student's name and ID.  
2. You choose if the student attended (1 for yes / 0 for no).  
3. The program displays the student's info and attendance status.

## 💡 Example Output
Enter student name: Amr
Enter student ID: 101
Did the student attend? (1 for yes / 0 for no): 1

=== Student Info ===
Name: Amr
ID: 101
Present :)

## 🛠️ Language Used
- C++

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Support multiple students using arrays or vectors  
- Add data saving to a file  
- Add menu-based navigation
