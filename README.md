# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects developed to practice and improve Object-Oriented Programming skills. Each project demonstrates different OOP concepts and real-world applications.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. **Student Attendance Tracker** üìö
- **Location**: `Student Attendance Tracker.cpp/`
- **Description**: A comprehensive system for tracking student attendance with features for adding students, marking attendance, and generating reports.
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, Objects, Data Encapsulation, File I/O
- **Main File**: `Student Attendance Tracker.cpp`

### 2. **OOP Calculator** üßÆ
- **Location**: `OOPCalculator/`
- **Description**: An advanced calculator implementing object-oriented design principles with multiple operation types and error handling.
- **OOP Concepts**: Class Design, Method Overloading, Error Handling
- **Main File**: `oop4.cpp`

### 3. **Triangle Laws Calculator** üìê
- **Location**: `Triangle laws/`
- **Description**: A mathematical calculator for triangle properties including area, perimeter, and angle calculations using trigonometric laws.
- **OOP Concepts**: Mathematical Modeling, Class Hierarchies, Static Methods
- **Main File**: `Triangle calculation.cpp`

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This collection demonstrates proficiency in:

- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and controlled access through private/public members
- **Class Design**: Creating well-structured, reusable classes
- **Object Instantiation**: Creating and managing object instances
- **Method Implementation**: Function overloading and specialized methods
- **File Operations**: Reading from and writing to files using OOP principles
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error checking and exception handling
- **Code Organization**: Structuring projects for maintainability and scalability

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or newer (C++17 recommended)
- Development environment: Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or any C++ IDE
- Basic knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming concepts

### Building and Running Projects

Each project can be compiled and run independently. Navigate to the specific project folder and follow these general steps:

#### Using g++ (MinGW/GCC):
```powershell
cd "Project Folder Name"
g++ -std=c++17 "main_file.cpp" -o output.exe
.\output.exe
```

#### Using Visual Studio:
1. Open the `.cpp` file in Visual Studio
2. Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run the project (Ctrl+F5)

## üìñ Project Details

For detailed information about each project, including specific usage instructions and implementation details, refer to the individual README files in each project folder:

- [Student Attendance Tracker README](Student%20Attendance%20Tracker.cpp/README.md)
- [OOP Calculator README](OOPCalculator/READEM.md)
- [Triangle Laws Calculator README](Triangle%20laws/README.md)

## üîß Development Journey

This repository represents a progressive learning path in OOP development:

1. **Beginner Level**: Basic class creation and object manipulation
2. **Intermediate Level**: Complex data structures and file handling
3. **Advanced Level**: Mathematical modeling and algorithm implementation

Each project builds upon concepts learned in previous projects, creating a comprehensive learning experience.
