# Triangle Laws Calculator

This project contains a C++ program for calculating triangle properties such as area, perimeter, triangle type, and computations based on angle and side laws.

## Project Structure

- `Triangle calculation.cpp` — Main source file: A simple program for performing triangle calculations.
- `README.md` — This file: Brief explanation and guide for users and contributors.

> **Note:** For detailed program input format and precise usage instructions, refer to the comments inside `Triangle calculation.cpp`, which may contain input examples or demonstrations.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or newer (C++17 recommended).
- (Optional) Development environment such as Visual Studio, MinGW/GCC, or clang.

## Build and Run Instructions (Windows / PowerShell)

1) Using g++ (MinGW or any GCC distribution):

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 "Triangle calculation.cpp" -o triangle.exe
.\triangle.exe
```

2) Using Microsoft compiler (Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt / cl):

```powershell
cl /EHsc "Triangle calculation.cpp"
"Triangle calculation.exe"
```

3) Running from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

Open `Triangle calculation.cpp` in Visual Studio or any preferred IDE, then Build and Run the project.

## Usage Examples and Tips

- If the program asks for side lengths: Enter decimal or integer values according to the program's instructions.
- If it asks for angles and sides: Ensure units (degrees or radians) are compatible with what the program reads — typically degrees are used.
- In case of input error, restart the program and review the required format in the comments inside `Triangle calculation.cpp`.

## Common Use Cases

- Calculate triangle area using base and height or Heron's formula (when side lengths are available).
- Determine triangle type (equilateral, right, obtuse) based on side lengths or angle measurements.
- Use sine or cosine laws to calculate a side or angle when some values are known.

## Contributing

- Suggest improvements or fixes by opening an Issue or making a Pull Request.
- If you want to add tests or input/output examples, place them in a new `examples/` folder under the directory with clear description.
